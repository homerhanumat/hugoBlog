# Biography

I serve as Chair of the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science at Georgetown College.  My original area of research was in ergodic theory, which is the study of the long-term average properties of systems that may appear to be chaotic and unpredictable in the short-term. From this work I was gradually drawn into probability and statistics.

I am very much engaged in the movement to teach statistics with R and related open-source software, and am currently developing R-related software for statistics education. Sometimes I perform statistical consultations, both inside and outside of the College.

Most recently I have assumed direction of the Computer Science minor at my College, for which I am implementing a curriculum that highlights data analysis, web design and the connections between these two areas.

Additional interests include the history of mathematics, Sanskrit philology, contemplative theologies and the practice of Ashtanga Yoga.

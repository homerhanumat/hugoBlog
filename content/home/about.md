# Biography

Homer White serves as Chair of the Department of Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science.  His original area of research was in ergodic theory, which is the study of the long-term average properties of systems that may appear to be chaotic and unpredictable in the short-term. From this work he gradually developed an interest in probability and statistics.

Homer is very much engaged in the movement to teach statistics at both elementary and advanced levels with R and related open-source software, and is currently developing R-related software for statistics education. He regularly performs statistical consultations both inside and outside of the College.

Most recently Homer has taken over direction of the Computer Science minor at Georgetown College.  As part of this project he has authored a textbook for beginning computer science students, and is building a program that highlightd data anlaysis, web design and connections between these two areas.

Other academic interests include the history of mathematics.  Homer has written articles on—and made translations from—both eighteenth-century European mathematicians and mathematicians working in India during Classical times. Homer also teaches in the College’s Foundations Program, authoring and maintaining the instructor-resource materials related to the Roman Catholic monk and author Thomas Merton.
